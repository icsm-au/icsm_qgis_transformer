# Documentation for the ICSM NTv2 Transformer Plugin

## Building/Rendering
This documentation is written in Markdown. You can render it to a PDF using the application `markdown-pdf`. In order to do this, you must first [install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and then you can install with `npm install -g markdown-pdf`. On a system that supports make, you can then run `make render` and a pdf will appear in this directory. On another system, you can run the command manually, like this: `markdown-pdf ntv2_transformations_plugin_docs.md -o ntv2_transformations_plugin_docs.pdf`.
